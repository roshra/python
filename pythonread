# Built in data types
None Type
Numeric Type
Sequences 
sets 
Mappings 

None Type : Data type does not conatin any value, in java its null object
it can be used as default value of an argument
if calling a function no value is passed, the default value will be null
in boolean expression the null represetns as false

Numeric Types:
int , float , complex

int is with out fractions , without decimals 
it will contain the negative and positive numbers
no limit in python to store the numbers
a = -57

float is with decimals
num = 55.67998
we can also use the exponentiation 
2.5 * 10 power 4 can be written as 2.5E4
x = 2.5E4 
here x will be automatically taken as float data type

complex numbers
# python program to add two complex numbers
c1 = 2.5 + 2.5J
c2 = 3.0 - 0.5J
sum = c1 + c2
print("sum = ", sum)
