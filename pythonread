# Built in data types
	None Type
	Numeric Type
	Sequences 
	sets 
	Mappings 

#None Type : 
	Data type does not conatin any value, in java its null object
	it can be used as default value of an argument
	if calling a function no value is passed, the default value will be null
	in boolean expression the null represetns as false

#Numeric Types:
	int , float , complex

	int is with out fractions , without decimals 
	it will contain the negative and positive numbers
	no limit in python to store the numbers
	a = -57

#float is with decimals
	num = 55.67998
	we can also use the exponentiation 
	2.5 * 10 power 4 can be written as 2.5E4
	x = 2.5E4 
	here x will be automatically taken as float data type

#complex numbers
	python program to add two complex numbers
	c1 = 2.5 + 2.5J
	c2 = 3.0 - 0.5J
	sum = c1 + c2
	print("sum = ", sum)

# Data type conversion
# Python program converts octal, binary and hex to decimal number system

s1 = "17"
s2 = "11100101"
s3 = "1c2"

n1 = int(s1,8)
n2 = int(s2,2)
n3 = int(s1,16)
print ("octal 17 converted to decimal value is : ",n1)
print ("binary 2 converted to decimal value is : ",n2)
print ("Hex 16 converted to decimal value is : ",n3)

Or

a = 10
b = bin(a)
print("value of binary b is ", b)

b = oct(a)
print("value of oct b is ", b)

b = hex(a)
print("value of hex b is ", b)

# Bool data type
a = 10
b = 20
if(a < b): print("value of a is greater than b : if condition is a bool true")
